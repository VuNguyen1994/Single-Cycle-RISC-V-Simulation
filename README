This is the C implementation of https://github.com/Shihao-Song/DREXEL-DISCO-RISC-V-Simulator.

/* Name: Dinh Nguyen, Tri Pham, Phi Manh Cuong
* ECEC 355 Project 1
* Compile as follow: gcc -o main Main.c Parser.c Registers.c Core.c
*/

To run:
./main cpu_traces/example_cpu_trace

To run matrix:
* Open core.c for edit, uncomment the initial value of data memory and register files for MATRIX under initCore() function
* Comment the initial value of data memory and register file for REPORT.
* DONOT CHANGE the DEFAULT initial value, data memory and register file is default as 1 and 0 respectively.
Output only prints out register files with value non-zero
* Recompile the program: gcc -o main Main.c Parser.c Registers.c Core.c
* Run matrix by ./main matrix
